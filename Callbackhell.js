/**
 * What is callback?
 * A callback is function called at the completion of a given task. This prevents any blocking  and allows to executes the code meanwhile.
 *
 * What is callback hell ?
 * Callback hell is the result of heavily nested callbacks that make the code not only unreadable but also difficult to maintain
 * Javascript uses callback and it's hard to identify about exact closing of a callback at the end.
 *
 * How to Get Rid of ?
 * For ridding of callback hell, we need to replace callbacks.
 * Callback is basically a convention that does not return instantly. It uses callback and takes some time to produce result.
 *
 * Make modular code, reusable code, give function a descriptive name.
 *
 * We can use async, await with Promise.
